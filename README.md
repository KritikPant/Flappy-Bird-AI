Flappy Bird AI

This is a flappy bird game with an AI which trains itself using the NEAT algorithm. This was made following the videos available on https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lwGZWXz5Qgta_YNX3_vLS2 on a channel called Tech With Tim.

In the project i learned many things:
Pygame fundamentals
How to set up a neural network
How to implement a NEAT genetic algoritm and understand how it works
How to create game physics in Pygame
Understanding how to choose parameters for the neural network (inputs and outputs)
and much more
